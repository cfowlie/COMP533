#The Concern
The concern we have chosen is persistence. This allows for accurate and effective saving of data within an application with little management by the end user.

#The Features
- Warning / Error output
- Configuration
	- Mutlitple data types
- Callbacks on certain operations
- Migrations
	- Between Data Types

#The Impacts

#Other notes
Although there are many existing persistence libraries, we chose to take this on as a new concern. This is due to none of us being farmiliar enough with existing libraries.
